<- Matrix  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class handles matrices.
The Matrix class suggests 7 class constants : IDENTITY, SCALE, RX, RY, RZ,
TRANSLATION and PROJECTION.
An instance can be constructed from a tab, with a compulsory key and optional
keys :
Compulsory key :
The key 'preset' is compulsory and determines the matrice's type to build. The
value must be one of the seven constant described before.
Optional key :
- 'scale' is compulsory if the preset is SCALE. 'scale' is a float.
- 'angle' is compulsory if the preset is RX, RY or RZ.
- 'vtc' is compulsory when the preset is TRANSLATION. 'vtc' is a instance of
a Vertex class.
- 'fov' is compulsory when the preset is PROJECTION. 'fov' is an integer.
- 'ratio' is compulsory when the preset is PROJECTION. 'ratio' is a ratio.
- 'near' is compulsory when the preset is PROJECTION. 'near' is a float.
- 'far' is compulsory when the preset is PROJECTION. 'far' is a float.
The class provides the following methods :
Matrix mult ( Matrix $rhs ):
It returns a new matrice from the multiplication of the two matrices.
Vertex transformVertex( Vertex  $vtx ):
returns a new Vertex from the transformation of the Vertex with the matrice.
